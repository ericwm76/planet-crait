# Planet Crait

Planet Crait is a Star Wars fan site, where users can view and favourite characters from the Star Wars movie they choose. Planet Crait is named after the the final scene in The Last Jedi, where The First Order attacks The Resistance in their hideout. We created this project during our 3rd module at Turing School of Software and Design.
